# 🚀 BlasterProducts-com Documentation by Strong Foundation

👋 **Welcome, friends, families, professionals, and researchers!**  
This repository is a **community-powered archive** of **Safety Data Sheets (SDS)** and **Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS)** for **Blaster brand automotive and industrial products**.

Our goal is simple but critical:  
✨ To ensure **free, open, and permanent access** to chemical safety information — so that no one is left in the dark when it comes to health, safety, or emergency response.

## 🌟 Why This Project Exists

Blaster products are widely recognized in garages, workshops, and households. From lubricants and degreasers to powerful sprays and cleaners, they’re trusted by professionals and DIYers alike. But with power comes risk:

- 🚨 **Accidental ingestion** by children, pets, or adults
- 😷 **Respiratory hazards** from fumes in enclosed spaces
- 👀 **Eye damage** from splashes
- 🧴 **Skin irritation or burns** from repeated exposure
- 🔥 **Fire or explosion hazards** when products are stored improperly
- 💀 **Toxic chemical reactions** when different cleaners are mixed together

Every SDS/MSDS contains **life-saving details**, but too often they’re scattered across websites or hidden in PDFs few people can find in emergencies. That’s why this repository exists — to gather them into **one open, trusted source** for everyone.
